# 0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions


## Learning Objectives
### Why Python programming is awesome:
- Python is known for its readability, simplicity, and versatility.
- It has a large and active community, resulting in a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks.
- Python is beginner-friendly and has a gentle learning curve.
- It is widely used in various domains, including web development, data science, machine learning, and automation.

### Why indentation is so important in Python:
- Indentation in Python is used to indicate the structure of code blocks.
- It replaces traditional braces `{}` used in other languages.
- Proper indentation is crucial for the interpreter to understand the code structure and hierarchy.

## How to use the if, if ... else statements:
- Example:

### How to use comments:
- Comments in Python start with `#`. Example:



### How to assign values to variables:
- Example:

### How to use while and for loops:
- Example:


### How is Python’s for different from C‘s?
- Python's `for` loop is more versatile and can iterate over any iterable (like lists, strings, etc.) directly.

### How to use break and continue statements:


### How to use else clauses on loops:
- The `else` clause in a loop is executed when the loop condition becomes False.


### What does the pass statement do, and when to use it:

- `pass` is a null operation; nothing happens when it is executed. It is often used as a placeholder.


### How to use range:
- Example:


### What is a function and how do you use functions:
- A function is a block of organized, reusable code. Example:


### What does return a function that does not use any return statement:
- If a function does not have a `return` statement, it implicitly returns `None`.

### Scope of variables:
- Variables have different scopes (local and global). The scope determines where the variable can be accessed.

### What’s a traceback:
- A traceback is a report that shows the call stack at a particular point in the program's execution. It's useful for debugging and identifying the source of errors.

### What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them:

Arithmetic operators include `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//` (floor division), `%` (modulo), and `**` (exponentiation). Example:
