# Higher-level programming & Algorithm

Module of **High-level programming** and **algorithm**, carried out during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **[ALX]**.

## Technologies
* All scripts written in vi editor
* All files are interpreted/compiled using `python3 (version 3.8.5)`
* All codes are run with `pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)`
* Tested on `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`

## Projects
All of the following folders are projects done during the studies:

| Project name | Description |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| [`0x00-python-hello_world`](https://github.com/obithelight/alx-higher_level_programming/tree/master/0x00-python-hello_world) | It aims to learn about the basics of python, its basics commands (print, input), and processes using python3 in the **Python language** |
| [`0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions`](https://github.com/obithelight/alx-higher_level_programming/tree/master/0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions) | It aims to learn about arithmetic operators, relational operators, boolean operators, comments, declaring variables and loops in the **Python language** |
| [`0x02-python-import_modules`](https://github.com/obithelight/alx-higher_level_programming/tree/master/0x02-python-import_modules) | It shows how to use code that is written in other python files. A module is essentially a python script containing functions, variables, and classes that you want to reuse in other parts of your **Python Program** |
