# 0x00. Python - Hello, World
- Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language known for its readability, simplicity, and versatility. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python has become one of the most popular programming languages globally, finding applications in various domains such as web development, data science, artificial intelligence, machine learning, automation, and more.

## Learning Objectives

### General
Why Python programming is awesome:
- Python is known for its simplicity and readability, making it easy for beginners to learn and for developers to express concepts with fewer lines of code.
- It has a large and active community, resulting in a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks for various domains.
- Python is versatile and used in diverse fields such as web development, data science, machine learning, automation, and more.

Who created Python:
- Python was created by Guido van Rossum, a Dutch programmer, who released the first version (Python 0.9.0) in February 1991.

Who is Guido van Rossum:
- Guido van Rossum is a computer programmer and the creator of the Python programming language. He has played a significant role in shaping the development of Python.

Where does the name ‘Python’ come from:
- The name "Python" for the programming language is not directly related to the snake. Guido van Rossum named it after the British comedy group Monty Python, whom he enjoyed.

What is the Zen of Python:
- The Zen of Python is a collection of guiding principles for writing computer programs in the Python language. It can be accessed by typing import this in a Python interpreter. The Zen emphasizes readability, simplicity, and practicality.

How to use the Python interpreter:
- Open a terminal or command prompt and type python to enter the Python interpreter. You can then type Python code interactively and see the results immediately.

How to print text and variables using print:
	print("Hello, World!")
	variable = 42
	print("The value of the variable is:", variable)

How to use strings:
- Strings in Python are defined using single (') or double (") quotes. Example:
-	my_string = "Hello, Python!"

What are indexing and slicing in Python:
- Indexing refers to accessing individual elements of a sequence (like a string or list) using their position. Slicing involves extracting a portion of a sequence. Example:
	my_string = "Python"
	print(my_string[0])  # Access the first character (indexing)
	print(my_string[1:4])  # Extract a slice from index 1 to 3 (slicing)

What is the official Python coding style and how to check your code with pycodestyle:
- The official Python coding style is defined in PEP 8 (Python Enhancement Proposal 8). You can check your code against PEP 8 using tools like pycodestyle or flake8. For example:
	pycodestyle your_file.py
